### Other
- Bedding: The only answer is to get the Aeronaut Hoverquilt - it is unmatched and of course we paired it with the Hest Pillows.

- Water: On the rear driver side, we mounted a 4-Gallon Day Tank from Water Port to the Trailrax Pak Rax. To make this really work, you need to bolt the Waterport to the Pak Rax without using the Waterport mount - it may require some drilling in the Pak Rax plate.

- Tools: On the passenger side we mounted a Krazy Beaver Shovel and a 28" Axe using the K9 Shovel and Axe Mount, but TrailRax has since designed their own Shovel and Axe Carrier that integrates better with their racks.
- Fridge: Dometic CFX3-45
- Power: Some more unfortunate news, the folks at Dakota Lithium discontinued the battery that we used in our Broncos. If I were to do it over again, I would simplify it and go with something like the Ecoflow DCDC charger and one of their portable batteries mounted on the cargo shelf.
