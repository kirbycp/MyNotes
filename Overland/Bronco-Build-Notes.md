## Exterior: Front To Back

### Fog Light Kit: On both our builds I used the Heretic Studio Fog Kit, but have since found that the Baja Design's kit is worth the upgrade over the Heretic.

### Antenna Mount: TrailRax TSAM

### Front Bumper: RTR Front Grille

### Roof Rack: The TrailRax TRMR Roof Rack is hands down the best roof rack for the Bronco.

### Roof Rack Light Bar: Like with the bumper, I used a Heretic 40" with the driving combo on both our roof racks, but I have since fallen in love with Baja Designs - look at the Baja Designs onX6+ 40" Straight with Clear Driving Combo light pattern for your Bronco.

### Rooftop Tent: Unfortunately the Go Fast Campers Superlite has been discontinued and their teasing of a re-release seems to have gone dark. The Bronco hard top isn't a fan of weight and I'm yet to find a rooftop tent that I like for the Bronco - In the meantime, add the TrailRax Billet Reinforcement to help carry a heavier tent like a Roofnest or CVT.

### Bedding: The only answer is to get the Aeronaut Hoverquilt - it is unmatched and of course we paired it with the Hest Pillows.

### Wheels: Fifteen52 Analog HD in Asphalt Black

### Windshield Wipers: If you're not upgrading to Scrubblades, what are you even doing?

### Steps: From everything I can see, the steps we used from Archetype Racing have been discontinued. I have added the Rockslide Engineering Lowering Steps to my Gladiator, and would 100% add them to a Bronco if I were building one today.

### Water: On the rear driver side, we mounted a 4-Gallon Day Tank from Water Port to the Trailrax Pak Rax. To make this really work, you need to bolt the Waterport to the Pak Rax without using the Waterport mount - it may require some drilling in the Pak Rax plate.

### Tools: On the passenger side we mounted a Krazy Beaver Shovel and a 28" Axe using the K9 Shovel and Axe Mount, but TrailRax has since designed their own Shovel and Axe Carrier that integrates better with their racks.

### Spare Tire Support: This is critical if you are copying what we did to Orlando's Bronco. You NEED support, and more than just a plate from Rough Country, you NEED the RTR Carrier.

### Spare Tire Rack: American Adventure Lab M.A.S.S. Spare Tire Platform

### Box: Roam Adventure Co 95L Box

### Mounts: Roam Adventure Co Quick Release Mounts

### Traction Boards: Maxtrax and while you're at it, get the Maxtrax Pin Tool.

### Bike Rack: Both Orlando and I did the 1-Up Bike rack. Don't do that. I have since upgraded to the Rig'd ecosystem, it is FAR better for off-road carrying. You'll need the Rig'd Rambleswing and a Rig'd Ramblerack.

## Interior: Back to Front
### Tailgate Table: Bronco Tailgater from Outback Adventure Products

### Bronco Drawers: American Adventure Labs M.A.S.S. Cargo System - their website is a bit of a mess to navigate, so here is basically what we used:

### M.A.S.S. Platform
- 6`" Drawer as the base drawer
- 4`" Drawer
- Fridge Slide
- Cargo Shelf

### Fridge: Dometic CFX3-45

### Power: Some more unfortunate news, the folks at Dakota Lithium discontinued the battery that we used in our Broncos. If I were to do it over again, I would simplify it and go with something like the Ecoflow DCDC charger and one of their portable batteries mounted on the cargo shelf.

### Dash: We kept the interior feeling very clean with the 67Designs Bronco Rail, here's the breakdown:

#### 67 Design's Rail

#### Medium Arm (for ham radio faceplate and mic)

#### Magnetic Mic and Magnetic Mic Ball Mount

### Ham Radio - I did the Yaesu FTM-400D, but have since upgraded to the 500D, mounting it is a bit of a trick, but there is a forum post on how to mount it under the steering wheel which makes the cable run to the dash for the faceplate easy.
