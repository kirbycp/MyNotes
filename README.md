# MyNotes

Testing a git repo for collection my nots on my personal projects. 

The process I am thinking of working on first:

1. Take physical notes in my book I am going to try using the Cornell Method.
2. After each section, open up VSCode and type all my notes using markdown.
3. Upload to my private repository I created on my Github account.

Access can be provided on all of my devices, either with a local repo synced with git hub or via the GitHub Desktop appp
